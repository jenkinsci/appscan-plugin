[![AppScan](img/AppScan.svg)](https://cloud.appscan.com)

Easily integrate security testing into your Jenkins builds using the HCL AppScan Jenkins plug-in. This plug-in enables you to execute SAST (Static Application Security Testing) scans using HCL AppScan on Cloud and HCL AppScan 360°, SCA (Software Composition Analysis) scans using HCL AppScan on Cloud and DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) scans using both HCL AppScan on Cloud (ASoC) and HCL AppScan Enterprise (ASE).

## Prerequisites

The plugin supports scanning through following HCL AppScan products:
 - HCL AppScan on Cloud
 - HCL AppScan 360°
 - HCL AppScan Enterprise

**HCL AppScan on Cloud prerequisites**

An account at the [HCL AppScan on
Cloud](https://cloud.appscan.com/AsoCUI/serviceui/home)
service. [Create an
application](http://help.hcltechsw.com/appscan/ASoC/ent_create_application.html?query=create)
on the service to associate with your scans.

**HCL AppScan 360° prerequisites**

To execute scans in HCL AppScan 360°, you must have access to an instance of AppScan 360°. To learn more about AppScan 360° features and installation, click [here](https://help.hcltechsw.com/appscan/360/1.0/appseccloud_plugins_integrations.html).

**HCL AppScan Enterprise prerequisites**

HCL AppScan Jenkins plug-in supports integration with HCL AppScan Enterprise for creation and execution of ADAC jobs. To use this integration, you must have access to a running instance of AppScan Enterprise Server  version 9.0.3.14 or later. Please note that Content Scan jobs are not supported through this integration.

 	HCL AppScan on Cloud(https://cloud.appscan.com) or HCL AppScan 360° service or
        this field is empty.
    -   **Test Name:** Specify a name to use for the scan. This value
        is used to distinguish this scan and its results from
        others.
    -   **Test Type:** Select the type of scan to run from the available
        options.
        -   **Dynamic Analysis (DAST):** Available for AppScan on Cloud only.
            -   **Starting URL**: Enter the URL from where you want the
                scan to start exploring the site.
            -   **Additional Options**: If selected, the following
                options are available:
                -   **Scan Type**: Select whether your site is a Staging
                    site (under development) or a Production site (live
                    and in use).
                -   **Test Optimization**: Following options are available:
                    - **Fast**: Select this option for approximately 97% issue coverage and twice as fast test stage speed.
                                  Recommended for security experts for more frequent scans.

                    available
                    [here](https://help.hcltechsw.com/appscan/ASoC/Presence_scanning.html).
                -   **Scan File**: If you have an AppScan Standard scan
                    file, enter its full path and file name in this
                    field. To learn more about AppScan Standard scan
                    files, see [this
                    topic](https://help.hcltechsw.com/appscan/ASoC/asd_AppScanStandard.html).
				-   **Application login**: Select a Login method from the available options so 
											AppScan can scan pages that require authentication. 
					- **Login not required**: Leave this selected if no login is needed.
					- **Login required: Username and password**: Select this option to allow login to the application 
																	using a username and password.
						-   **Login User** and **Login Password**: If your app requires login, enter valid user credentials so that 
																	Application Security on Cloud can log in to the site.
						-   **Extra Field**: If your app requires a third credential, enter it in this field.
					- **Login required: Record login**: Select this option to allow login to the application using a recorded login sequence.
						-   **Login Sequence File**: Provide a path to the login sequence file data. Supported file type is .CONFIG.
        -   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA)**
            -   **Target**: Enter the complete path to the directory containing the files to scan, or provide the full path to an existing .irx file. Leave this field empty to scan all supported files within the workspace directory.
        -   **Static Analysis (SAST)**
            -   **Target**: Enter the complete path to the directory containing the files to scan, or provide the full path to an existing .irx .war, .ear, .jar or .zip file. Leave this field empty to scan all supported files within the workspace directory.
            -   **Scan Method**
                -   **Generate IRX**: Generate an IRX archive locally from the specified files and folders.
                    -   **Additional Options**: If selected, the following options are available:
                        -   Open Source Only: AppScan on Cloud only. Analyze open source and third-party packages used by your code. Aa specific ASoC Software Composition Analysis (SCA) subscription is required.
                        -   Source Code Only: Analyze source code only.
                        -   Select Scan Speed: Optimize scan speed and results according to development stage. Choose faster scans early in the development lifecycle to identify basic security issues; choose thorough scans later in the cycle to ensure complete coverage for your application.
                            -   Normal: Performs a complete analysis of the code, identifying vulnerabilities in detail and differentiating issues that could be reported as false positives. This scan takes the longest to complete.
                            -   Fast: Performs a comprehensive analysis of your files to identify vulnerabilities, taking longer to complete than “Faster” or “Fastest” scans.
                            -   Faster: Provides a medium level of detail of analysis and identification of security issues. This scan takes more time to complete than the “Fastest” option.
                            -   Fastest: Performs a surface-level analysis of your files to identify the most pressing issues for remediation, taking the least amount of time to complete.
                -   **Upload files and folders**: Upload files and folders directly to AppScan for immediate scanning preparation, resulting in faster processing.
    -   **Allow intervention by scan enablement team:** Available for AppScan on Cloud only. 
        -   When selected (default), our scan enablement team will step in if the scan fails, or if 
        no issues are found, and try to fix the configuration. This may delay 
        the scan result.            
    -   **Suspend job until security analysis completes:** If selected,
        the Jenkins job will pause until security analysis has completed
        and the results have been retrieved from the service. If
        unselected, the job will continue once the scan has been
        submitted to the analysis service.
    -   **Fail job if:** If selected, the Jenkins job will fail if the
        finding count(s) exceed the specified thresholds (see below).
    -   **Add Condition:** Allows you to add thresholds for the number
        of findings that will cause a build to fail. You can specify
        thresholds for total, critical, high, medium, and/or low finding counts.
        If multiple conditions are added, they will be treated as though
        they are separated by a logical OR.

**Notes:**
- Support for SAST scanning using HCL AppScan 360° was added for version 1.1.0 of the Jenkins extension. The existing HCL AppScan on Cloud connection endpoint and build step have been enhanced to allow users to connect to HCL AppScan 360°.
- AppScan on Cloud (ASoC) now performs SAST and SCA analysis as separate scans. To execute an open-source only scan, use the Software Composition Analysis (SCA) scan type. The open-source only option will be removed from SAST scans in a future release.

**Known Issues**
- ASoC is no longer providing Mobile Scan support. Refer to 
[this page](https://support.hcltechsw.com/community?id=community_blog&sys_id=a537a63adbb6f054a45ad9fcd396191f) for more information. 
The Mobile Scan functionality
has been removed from Jenkins since version 1.0.10. The existing jobs that 
have Mobile Scan configurations must therefore be updated accordingly.
- If you are unable to view the scan report on the Jenkins, first verify that the "Test Name" field. Test Name can't contain any of the following characters: \/:*?"<>|
