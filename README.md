# HCL AppScan Jenkins Plug-in

Easily integrate security testing into your Jenkins builds using the HCL AppScan Jenkins Plug-in. This plug-in enables you to execute DAST(Dynamic Application Security Testing) scans using HCL AppScan On Cloud and HCL AppScan Enterprise.

# Prerequisites

- An account on the [HCL AppScan on Cloud](https://cloud.appscan.com/) service. You'll need to [create an application](https://help.hcltechsw.com/appscan/ASoC/ent_create_application.html) on the service to associate your scans with.

- Post 1.3.0 release, HCL AppScan Jenkins Plug-in will support integration with HCL AppScan Enterprise for creation and execution of ADAC jobs. Hence, if you intend to use this integration, you would need login access to a running instance of AppScan Enterprise Server. Please note that Content Scan jobs are not supported with Jenkins integration.
