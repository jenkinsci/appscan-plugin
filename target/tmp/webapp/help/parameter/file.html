<div>
    Accepts a file submission from a browser as a build parameter. The uploaded
    file will be placed at the specified location in the workspace, which your
    build can then access and use.
    <p>This is useful for many situations, such as:<ol>
    <li>Letting people run tests on the artifacts they built.</li>
    <li>Automating the upload/release/deployment process by allowing the user to
    place the file.</li>
    <li>Perform data processing by uploading a dataset.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        The name of the submitted file is available in the environment variable
        whose name is the same as file location. For example, if you set the file
        location to be <tt>abc.zip</tt>, then <tt>${abc.zip}</tt> would give you
        the original file name passed from the browser (such as <tt>my.zip</tt>.)
        The name will not include the directory name portion.
    </p>
    <p>
        File upload is optional. If a user chooses not to upload anything,
        Jenkins will simply skips this parameter and will not place
        anything (but it also will not delete anything that's already in the
        workspace.)
